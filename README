List of programs for non-compromise opinion dynamics (November 2011).
Supplement to: Kaan Ozturk, "Dynamics of discrete opinions without compromise", submitted to Advances in Complex Systems. (http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4624)

opdyn.h, libopdyn.c
-------------------
Library code for other programs.

singlerun.c
--------------------------
	Uses homogeneous agents and completely connected interaction graph.
	Initial distribution of opinions is uniform.
	Runs the simulation once.
	Prints the popularity array of opinions at every time step.
	Requires the GNU Scientific Library (for random numbers only -- can be modified to use another library).
	Compile with:
	gcc singlerun.c libopdyn.c -std=gnu99 -Wall -lm -lgsl -lgslcblas -o singlerun
	
	Example use:
	singlerun 30 3 1 -- 30 agents, 3 opinions, confidence bound 1.
	singlerun 30 3 1 1 -- Same as above, with bias to pairwise majority.
	singlerun 30 3 1 2 -- Same as above, with bias to global majority.
	
ensemble.c
---------------------------------
	Uses homogeneous agents and completely connected interaction graph.
	Initial distribution of opinions is uniform.
	Runs the system many times, prints the absorption time and absorbing state in each case.
	Output can be captured and analyzed with other programs.
	Requires the GNU Scientific Library (for random numbers only -- can be modified to use another library).
	Compile with:
	gcc ensemble.c libopdyn.c -std=gnu99 -Wall -lm -lgsl -lgslcblas -o ensemble
	
	Example use:
	ensemble 30 3 1 100 -- 30 agents, 3 opinions, confidence bound 1, 100 runs.
	ensemble 30 3 1 100 1 -- Same as above, with bias to pairwise majority.

opdynmarkovQ3d1.m (Matlab)
-------------------------------
	Sets up the Markov matrix for unbiased, homogeneous, completely
	connected system with three opinions and confidence bound 1.
	Prints all absorbing states and their probabilities.
	Plots the probability of state (i,0,N-i) vs. i/N.
	Plots the cumulative distribution function of absorption time.
	Runs interactively in Matlab.
	
opdynmarkovQ3d1_ver2.m (Matlab)
-------------------------------
	Same as above, but the matrix is set up such that at every time step
	any two agents are paired (opinion change does not have to take 
	place). This defines a time step as any meeting between
	agents, whether they are compatible or not. Included here for
	any possible interest.
	
opdynmarkovQ3d2.m (Matlab)
-------------------------------
	Sets up the Markov matrix for unbiased, homogeneous, completely
	connected system with three opinions and confidence bound 1.
	Prints all absorbing states and their probabilities.
	Plots the cumulative distribution function of absorption time.
	(There are no polarized absorbing states.)
	Runs interactively in Matlab.

opdynmarkovQ4d1.m (Matlab)
-------------------------------
	Sets up the Markov matrix for unbiased, homogeneous, completely
	connected system with four opinions and confidence bound 1.
	Prints all absorbing states and their probabilities.
	Plots the probability of state (i,0,0,N-i) vs. i/N.
	Plots the cumulative distribution function of absorption time.
	Runs interactively in Matlab.
	
opdynvisual.m (Matlab)
----------------------
	Visualizes the evolution of the system until absorption.
	Displays each agent's opinion, and the popularity
	histogram of opinions at every step.
	Prints the absorbing state and absorption time.
	Runs interactively in Matlab.
	
absstateprob_C.m (Matlab)
--------------------------------
	Runs the C program "ensemble" and captures the output.
	"ensemble" must be compiled before this program is used.
	Plots the probability of absorbing state [i, 0, N-i] vs. i
	Prints the probability of consensus and of polarization.
	Runs interactively in Matlab.
	
absstate_ensemble_generate.m (Matlab)
-------------------------------------
	Runs the C program "ensemble" for various N,Q,d and bias.
	"ensemble" must be compiled before this program is used.
	For each run:
		- Generates data file using the program.
		- Prints the probability vector of having 1,2,3,...
		 different opinions at absorbing state.
		- Plots the cumulative distribution function for absorption time.
	Runs interactively in Matlab.
